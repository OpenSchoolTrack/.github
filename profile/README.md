## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As the creators of OpenSchoolTrack, we have set our sights on a lofty goal - to develop a comprehensive suite of tools that can streamline the management of schools. Our vision encompasses backend APIs constructed using Rust, as well as SDKs to support multiple programming languages. Additionally, we plan to incorporate user interface utility components that are compatible with popular UI frameworks such as ReactJS and Vue, among others. By bringing together such a diverse array of resources, we hope to create something truly meaningful for the education community.
